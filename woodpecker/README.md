# Woodpecker

## Getting started (Implementing into your repository)
Either...
- ... in your repository root, create the `.woodpecker.yml` file, where you add everything
- ... in your repository root, create a `woodpecker/` folder. Insert any amount of `*.yml` files within.

The templates provided in this repository are split up by default, making them fit for the latter option. But a simple rename to `.woodpecker.yml` is enough to adapt to the first workflow.
