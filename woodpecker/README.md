# Woodpecker

## Getting started (Implementing into your repository)
Either...
- ... in your repository root, add `.woodpecker.yml`, where you add everything
- In your repository root, create a `woodpecker/` folder. Insert any amount of `*.woodpecker.yml` files within.

The templates provided in this repository are split up by default for the latter option, but a simple rename to `.woodpecker.yml` is enough to adapt to the first.
